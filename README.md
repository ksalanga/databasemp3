# databasemp3
Accessing MP3 files to place into a database using Java

In this project, I used file systems, directories, and accessing databases to find MP3 Files and input those files into an HTML server.

I searched an "Intermediate Java" project, and this mp3 project is one of the first links that I've found that was very comprehensive, but it didn't hold your hand too much.

The Project focused on 5 aspects of programming:
"
    read in a directory of your harddrive and scan it for .mp3 files (learn core java skills / files access)

    analyze the files for their title, band, year metadata (lean how to use external Java libraries)

    save that metadata to a database (learn how to use JDBC)

    and then finally open up a webbrowser (learn some more core java)

    and display the saved data as a HTML page (learn about servlets)
"

I did each of the steps by myself, and then I referenced the solutions after I finished each one.
